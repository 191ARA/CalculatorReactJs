Documentation for Calculator

Calculator is a calculator developed using React. It supports basic mathematical operations, keyboard input handling, and special functions such as squaring, cubing, and calculating the reciprocal of a number.

Technologies Used
React: For state management and UI rendering.
Tailwind CSS: For styling UI elements.

Functionality

State

input (useState): Stores the current expression entered by the user.

Effects
useEffect: Listens for keypress events and triggers corresponding handlers when numeric or operator keys are pressed.

Main Functions

handleKeyPress(event)
Filters key presses, allowing only valid ones (0-9, +, -, *, /, ^, Enter, Backspace).
Calls handleClick("=") when Enter is pressed.
Removes the last character from input when Backspace is pressed.

isValidInput(value)
Checks whether a character can be added to input.
Prevents consecutive operators from being entered.

handleClick(value)
Performs different actions depending on the passed value:
C: Clears input.
=: Evaluates the expression using eval(), replacing ^ with **.
x²: Squares the current value.
x³: Cubes the current value.
1/x: Calculates the reciprocal.
Any other valid value is added to input.
Markup Structure
Main Wrapper: A div with classes: flex flex-col items-center bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-lg w-72.
Input Display: A div with classes: mb-4 p-4 bg-black rounded text-right text-2xl h-16 flex items-center justify-end.
Calculator Buttons: Arranged in a grid (grid grid-cols-4 gap-2). Each button has classes: bg-gray-700 p-4 rounded-lg text-white text-xl hover:bg-gray-600.
C Button: Highlighted in red with bg-red-600.

Rendering
The calculator is rendered into the root element using:
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(<Calculator />);
